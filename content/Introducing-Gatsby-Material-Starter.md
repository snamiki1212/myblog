Around a year ago, this project was one of the first ones ported to the `v1` version of GatsbyJS.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great news! Gatsby Material starter is now based on stable V1 of <a href="https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs">@gatsbyjs</a>!<a href="https://t.co/P2JqNbcRmk">https://t.co/P2JqNbcRmk</a></p>&mdash; Ruben Harutyunyan (@Vagr9K) <a href="https://twitter.com/Vagr9K/status/883073085963993089">July 6, 2017</a></blockquote>
